                <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development.
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript and many other languages is mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).</p>

                    Getting Started
                </header>
                <p>The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first
program to write is the same for all languages:
Print the words</p>

                <code>hello, world</code>

                <p>This is a big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere,
compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. With these
mechanical details mastered, everything else is comparatively easy.
In C, the program to print ``hello, world'' is</p>

            <pre><code>
                #include "stdio.h"
                main()
                {
                    printf("hello, world\n");
                }
                </code></pre>

                <p>Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on
the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ``.c'',
such as hello.c, then compile it with the command</p>

                <code>cc hello.c</code>

                <p>If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a character or misspelling something, the
compilation will proceed silently, and make an executable file called a.out. If you run a.out
by typing the command</p>

                <code>a.out</code>

                <p>it will print</p>

                <code>hello, world</code>

                <p>On other systems, the rules will be different; check with a local expert.
Now, for some explanations about the program itself. A C program, whatever its size, consists
of functions and variables. A function contains statements that specify the computing
operations to be done, and variables store values used during the computation. C functions are
like the subroutines and functions in Fortran or the procedures and functions of Pascal. Our
example is a function named main. Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever
names you like, but ``main'' is special - your program begins executing at the beginning of
main. This means that every program must have a main somewhere.
main will usually call other functions to help perform its job, some that you wrote, and others
from libraries that are provided for you. The first line of the program,</p>

                <pre><code>#include <stdio.h></code></pre>

                <p>tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library; the line
appears at the beginning of many C source files. The standard library is described in Chapter 7
and Appendix B.
One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a
list of values, called arguments, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name
surround the argument list. In this example, main is defined to be a function that expects no
arguments, which is indicated by the empty list ( ).</p>

<pre><code>

    #include "stdio.h"                  include information about standard library

    main()                              define a function called main
                                        that received no argument values
    {                                   statements of main are enclosed in braces
        printf("hello, world\n");       main calls library function printf
    }                                   to print this sequence of characters
                                        \n represents the newline character
</code></pre>

<p>The statements of a function are enclosed in braces { } . The function main contains only one
statement,</p>
<code>printf("hello, world\n");</code>
<p>A function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of arguments, so this calls
the function printf with the argument "hello, world\n" . printf is a library function that
prints output, in this case the string of characters between the quotes.</p>

<p>A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n" , is called a character
string or string constant. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as
arguments for printf and other functions.</p>

<p>The sequence \n in the string is C notation for the newline character, which when printed
advances the output to the left margin on the next line. If you leave out the \n (a worthwhile
experiment), you will find that there is no line advance after the output is printed. You must
use \n to include a newline character in the printf argument; if you try something like</p>

<code>printf("hello, world");</code>

<p>the C compiler will produce an error message.</p>

<p>printf never supplies a newline character automatically, so several calls may be used to build
up an output line in stages. Our first program could just as well have been written</p>

<pre> <code>
    #include "stdio.h"
    main()
    {
    printf("hello, ");
    printf("world");
    printf("\n")
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>to produce identical output.</p>

<p>Notice that \n represents only a single character. An escape sequence like \n provides a
general and extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. Among
the others that C provides are \t for tab, \b for backspace, \" for the double quote and \\ for
the backslash itself. There is a complete list in Section 2.3.</p>

                    Variables and Arithmetic Expressions
                </header>

                <p>The next program uses the formula o C=(5/9)( o F-32) to print the following table of Fahrenheit
temperatures and their centigrade or Celsius equivalents. The program itself still consists of the definition of a single function named main . It is longer
than the one that printed `` hello, world '', but not complicated. It introduces several new
ideas, including comments, declarations, variables, arithmetic expressions, loops , and
formatted output.</p>

<pre> <code>
    #include "stdio.h"
    /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
        for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */

    main()
    {
        int fahr, celsius;
        int lower, upper, step;

        lower = 0;
        upper = 300;
        step = 20;
        /* lower limit of temperature scale */
        /* upper limit */
        /* step size */

        fahr = lower;
        while (fahr <= upper) {
            celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;
            printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
            fahr = fahr + step;
        }
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>The two lines</p>

<pre> <code>
    /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
        for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
</code> </pre>

<p>are a comment, which in this case explains briefly what the program does. Any characters
between /* and */ are ignored by the compiler; they may be used freely to make a program
easier to understand. Comments may appear anywhere where a blank, tab or newline can.</p>

<p>In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the beginning of the
function before any executable statements. A declaration announces the properties of
variables; it consists of a name and a list of variables, such as</p>

<pre> <code>
    int fahr, celsius;
    int lower, upper, step;
</code> </pre>

<p>The type int means that the variables listed are integers; by contrast with float , which means
floating point, i.e., numbers that may have a fractional part. The range of both int and float
depends on the machine you are using; 16-bits int s, which lie between -32768 and +32767,
are common, as are 32-bit int s. A float number is typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least six
significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10 <sup>-38</sup> and 10 <sup>38</sup> .</p>

<p>The size of these objects is also machine-dependent. There are also arrays, structures and
unions of these basic types, pointers to them, and functions that return them, all of which we
will meet in due course.</p>

<p>Computation in the temperature conversion program begins with the assignment statements</p>

<pre> <code>
    lower = 0;
    upper = 300;
    step = 20;
</code> </pre>

<p>which set the variables to their initial values. Individual statements are terminated by
semicolons.</p>

<p>Each line of the table is computed the same way, so we use a loop that repeats once per output
line; this is the purpose of the while loop</p>

<pre> <code>
    while (fahr <= upper) {
        ...
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>The while loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. If it is true ( fahr
is less than or equal to upper ), the body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces) is
executed. Then the condition is re-tested, and if true, the body is executed again. When the test
becomes false ( fahr exceeds upper ) the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement
that follows the loop. There are no further statements in this program, so it terminates.</p>

<p>The body of a while can be one or more statements enclosed in braces, as in the temperature
converter, or a single statement without braces, as in</p>

<pre> <code>
    while (i < j)
    i = 2 * i;
</code> </pre>

<p>In either case, we will always indent the statements controlled by the while by one tab stop
(which we have shown as four spaces) so you can see at a glance which statements are inside
the loop. The indentation emphasizes the logical structure of the program. Although C
compilers do not care about how a program looks, proper indentation and spacing are critical
in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per
line, and using blanks around operators to clarify grouping. The position of braces is less
important, although people hold passionate beliefs. We have chosen one of several popular
styles. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently.</p>

<p>Most of the work gets done in the body of the loop. The Celsius temperature is computed and
assigned to the variable celsius by the statement</p>

<code>celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;</code>

<p>The reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 instead of just multiplying by 5/9 is that in
C, as in many other languages, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded.
Since 5 and 9 are integers. 5/9 would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures
would be reported as zero.</p>

<p>This example also shows a bit more of how printf works. printf is a general-purpose
output formatting function, which we will describe in detail in Chapter 7. Its first argument is a
string of characters to be printed, with each % indicating where one of the other (second, third,
...) arguments is to be substituted, and in what form it is to be printed. For instance, %d
specifies an integer argument, so the statement</p>

<code>printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);</code>

<p>causes the values of the two integers fahr and celsius to be printed, with a tab ( \t ) between
them.</p>

<p>Each % construction in the first argument of printf is paired with the corresponding second
argument, third argument, etc.; they must match up properly by number and type, or you will
get wrong answers.</p>

<p>By the way, printf is not part of the C language; there is no input or output defined in C
itself. printf is just a useful function from the standard library of functions that are normally
accessible to C programs. The behaviour of printf is defined in the ANSI standard, however,
so its properties should be the same with any compiler and library that conforms to the
standard.</p>

<p>In order to concentrate on C itself, we don't talk much about input and output until chapter 7.
In particular, we will defer formatted input until then. If you have to input numbers, read the
discussion of the function scanf in Section 7.4. scanf is like printf , except that it reads
input instead of writing output.</p>

<p>There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is
that the output isn't very pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if
we augment each %d in the printf statement with a width, the numbers printed will be right-
justified in their fields. For instance, we might say</p>

<code>printf("%3d %6d\n", fahr, celsius);</code>

<p>to print the first number of each line in a field three digits wide, and the second in a field six
digits wide.</p>

<p>The more serious problem is that because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius
temperatures are not very accurate; for instance, 0 o F is actually about -17.8 o C, not -17. To get
more accurate answers, we should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer. This
requires some changes in the program. Here is the second version:</p>

<pre> <code>
    #include "stdio.h"
    /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
        for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300; floating-point version */

    main()
    {
        float fahr, celsius;
        float lower, upper, step;

        lower = 0;              /* lower limit of temperatuire scale */
        upper = 300;            /* upper limit */
        step = 20;              /* step size */

        fahr = lower;
        while (fahr <= upper) {
            celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32.0);
            printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);15
            fahr = fahr + step;
            }
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>This is much the same as before, except that fahr and celsius are declared to be float and
the formula for conversion is written in a more natural way. We were unable to use 5/9 in the
previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. A decimal point in a
constant indicates that it is floating point, however, so 5.0/9.0 is not truncated because it is
the ratio of two floating-point values.</p>

<p>If an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an integer operation is performed. If an
arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the
integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. If we had written
(fahr-32) , the 32 would be automatically converted to floating point. Nevertheless, writing
floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they have integral values
emphasizes their floating-point nature for human readers.</p>

<p>The detailed rules for when integers are converted to floating point are in Chapter 2. For now,
notice that the assignment</p>

<code>fahr = lower;</code>

<p>and the test</p>

<code>while (fahr <= upper)</code>

<p>also work in the natural way - the int is converted to float before the operation is done.</p>

<p>The printf conversion specification %3.0f says that a floating-point number (here fahr ) is to
be printed at least three characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digits. %6.1f
describes another number ( celsius ) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1
digit after the decimal point.</p>

            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="The_for_statement">
                <header class="section-header">
                    The for statement
                </header>

                <p>There are plenty of different ways to write a program for a particular task. Let's try a variation
on the temperature converter.</p>

<pre> <code>
    #include "stdio.h"
    /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */

    main()
    {
        int fahr;
        for (fahr = 0; fahr <= 300; fahr = fahr + 20)
        printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>This produces the same answers, but it certainly looks different. One major change is the
elimination of most of the variables; only fahr remains, and we have made it an int . The
lower and upper limits and the step size appear only as constants in the for statement, itself a
new construction, and the expression that computes the Celsius temperature now appears as
the third argument of printf instead of a separate assignment statement.</p>

<p>This last change is an instance of a general rule - in any context where it is permissible to use
the value of some type, you can use a more complicated expression of that type. Since the third
argument of printf must be a floating-point value to match the %6.1f , any floating-point
expression can occur here.</p>

<p>The for statement is a loop, a generalization of the while . If you compare it to the earlier
while , its operation should be clear. Within the parentheses, there are three parts, separated by
semicolons. The first part, the initialization</p>

<code>fahr = 0</code>

<p>is done once, before the loop proper is entered. The second part is the
test or condition that controls the loop:</p>

<code>fahr <= 300</code>

<p>This condition is evaluated; if it is true, the body of the loop (here a single ptintf ) is
executed. Then the increment step</p>

<code>fahr = fahr + 20</code>

<p>is executed, and the condition re-evaluated. The loop terminates if the condition has become
false. As with the while , the body of the loop can be a single statement or a group of
statements enclosed in braces. The initialization, condition and increment can be any
expressions.</p>

<p>The choice between while and for is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer. The for is
usually appropriate for loops in which the initialization and increment are single statements and
logically related, since it is more compact than while and it keeps the loop control statements
together in one place.</p>

                    Symbolic Constants
                </header>

                <p>A final observation before we leave temperature conversion forever. It's bad practice to bury
``magic numbers'' like 300 and 20 in a program; they convey little information to someone who
might have to read the program later, and they are hard to change in a systematic way. One
way to deal with magic numbers is to give them meaningful names. A #define line defines a
symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters:</p>

<code>#define name replacement list</code>

<p>Thereafter, any occurrence of name (not in quotes and not part of another name) will be
replaced by the corresponding replacement text. The name has the same form as a variable
name: a sequence of letters and digits that begins with a letter. The replacement text can be
any sequence of characters; it is not limited to numbers.</p>

<pre> <code>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #define LOWER  0        /* lower limit of table */
    #define UPPER  300      /* upper limit */
    #define STEP   20       /* step size */

    /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */
    main()
    {
        int fahr;
        for (fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP)
            printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>The quantities LOWER , UPPER and STEP are symbolic constants, not variables, so they do not
appear in declarations. Symbolic constant names are conventionally written in upper case so
they can ber readily distinguished from lower case variable names. Notice that there is no
semicolon at the end of a #define line.</p>

                    Character Input and Output
                </header>

                <p>We are going to consider a family of related programs for processing character data. You will
find that many programs are just expanded versions of the prototypes that we discuss here.</p>

<p>The model of input and output supported by the standard library is very simple. Text input or
output, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to, is dealt with as streams of
characters. A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists of
zero or more characters followed by a newline character. It is the responsibility of the library to
make each input or output stream confirm this model; the C programmer using the library need
not worry about how lines are represented outside the program.</p>

<p>The standard library provides several functions for reading or writing one character at a time,
of which getchar and putchar are the simplest. Each time it is called, getchar reads the next
input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. That is, after</p>

<code>c = getchar();</code>

<p>the variable c contains the next character of input. The characters normally come from the
keyboard; input from files is discussed in Chapter 7.</p>

<p>The function putchar prints a character each time it is called:</p>

<code>putchar(c);</code>

<p>prints the contents of the integer variable c as a character, usually on the screen. Calls to
putchar and printf may be interleaved; the output will appear in the order in which the calls
are made.</p>

<p>Let is write a program to count the number of occurrences of each digit, of white space
characters (blank, tab, newline), and of all other characters. This is artificial, but it permits us
to illustrate several aspects of C in one program.</p>

<p>There are twelve categories of input, so it is convenient to use an array to hold the number of
occurrences of each digit, rather than ten individual variables. Here is one version of the
program:</p>

<pre> <code>
    #include "stdio.h"
    /* count digits, white space, others */

    main()
    {
        int c, i, nwhite, nother;

        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)

        printf(", white space = %d, other = %d\n", nwhite, nother);
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>The output of this program on itself is</p>

<code>digits = 9 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1, white space = 123, other = 345</code>

<p>The declaration</p>

<code>int ndigit[10];</code>

<p>declares ndigit to be an array of 10 integers. Array subscripts always start at zero in C, so the
elements are ndigit[0], ndigit[1], ..., ndigit[9] . This is reflected in the for loops
that initialize and print the array.</p>

<p>A subscript can be any integer expression, which includes integer variables like i , and integer
constants.</p>

<p>This particular program relies on the properties of the character representation of the digits.
For example, the test</p>

<code>if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')</code>

<p>determines whether the character in c is a digit. If it is, the numeric value of that digit is</p>

<code>c - '0'</code>

<p>This works only if '0', '1', ..., '9' have consecutive increasing values. Fortunately, this
is true for all character sets.</p>

<p>By definition, char s are just small integers, so char variables and constants are identical to
int s in arithmetic expressions. This is natural and convenient; for example c-'0' is an integer
expression with a value between 0 and 9 corresponding to the character '0' to '9' stored in c ,
and thus a valid subscript for the array ndigit .</p>

<p>The decision as to whether a character is a digit, white space, or something else is made with
the sequence</p>

<pre>
<code>
    if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')
        ++ndigit[c-'0'];
    else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
        ++nwhite;
    else
        ++nother;
</code>
</pre>

<p>The pattern</p>

<pre> <code>
    if (condition 1 )
        statement <sub>1</sub>
    else if (condition 2 )
        statement <sub>2</sub>
        ...
        ...
    else
        statement <sub>n</sub>
</code> </pre>

<p>occurs frequently in programs as a way to express a multi-way decision. The conditions are
evaluated in order from the top until some condition is satisfied; at that point the
corresponding statement part is executed, and the entire construction is finished. (Any
statement can be several statements enclosed in braces.) If none of the conditions is satisfied,
the statement after the final else is executed if it is present. If the final else and statement are
omitted, as in the word count program, no action takes place. There can be any number of</p>

<pre> <code>
    else if (condition)
        statement
</code> </pre>

<p>groups between the initial if and the final else .</p>

<p>As a matter of style, it is advisable to format this construction as we have shown; if each if
were indented past the previous else , a long sequence of decisions would march off the right
side of the page.</p>

                    Functions
                </header>

                <p>In C, a function is equivalent to a subroutine or function in Fortran, or a procedure or function
in Pascal. A function provides a convenient way to encapsulate some computation, which can
then be used without worrying about its implementation. With properly designed functions, it
is possible to ignore how a job is done; knowing what is done is sufficient. C makes the sue of
functions easy, convinient and efficient; you will often see a short function defined and called
only once, just because it clarifies some piece of code.</p>

<p>So far we have used only functions like printf , getchar and putchar that have been
provided for us; now it's time to write a few of our own. Since C has no exponentiation
operator like the ** of Fortran, let us illustrate the mechanics of function definition by writing
a function power(m,n) to raise an integer m to a positive integer power n . That is, the value of
power(2,5) is 32. This function is not a practical exponentiation routine, since it handles only
positive powers of small integers, but it's good enough for illustration.(The standard library
contains a function pow(x,y) that computes x <sup>y</sup> .)</p>

<p>Here is the function power and a main program to exercise it, so you can see the whole
structure at once.</p>

<pre> <code>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int power(int m, int n);
    /* test power function */

    main()
    {
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
            printf("%d %d %d\n", i, power(2,i), power(-3,i));

        return 0;
    }

    /* power: raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */
    int power(int base, int n)
    {
        int i, p;
        p = 1;

        for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            p = p * base;

        return p;
    }

</code> </pre>

<p>A function definition has this form:</p>

<pre> <code>
    return-type function-name(parameter declarations, if any)
    {
        declarations
        statements
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>Function definitions can appear in any order, and in one source file or several, although no
function can be split between files. If the source program appears in several files, you may have
to say more to compile and load it than if it all appears in one, but that is an operating system
matter, not a language attribute. For the moment, we will assume that both functions are in the
same file, so whatever you have learned about running C programs will still work.</p>

<p>The function power is called twice by main , in the line</p>

<code>printf("%d %d %d\n", i, power(2,i), power(-3,i));</code>

<p>Each call passes two arguments to power , which each time returns an integer to be formatted
and printed. In an expression, power(2,i) is an integer just as 2 and i are. (Not all functions
produce an integer value; we will take this up in Chapter 4.)</p>

<p>The first line of power itself,</p>

<code>int power(int base, int n)</code>

<p>declares the parameter types and names, and the type of the result that the function returns.
The names used by power for its parameters are local to power , and are not visible to any
other function: other routines can use the same names without conflict. This is also true of the
variables i and p : the i in power is unrelated to the i in main .</p>

<p>We will generally use parameter for a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function.
The terms formal argument and actual argument are sometimes used for the same distinction.</p>


<p>The value that power computes is returned to main by the return : statement. Any expression
may follow return :</p>

<code>return expression;</code>

<p>A function need not return a value; a return statement with no expression causes control, but
no useful value, to be returned to the caller, as does ``falling off the end'' of a function by
reaching the terminating right brace. And the calling function can ignore a value returned by a
function.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that there is a return statement at the end of main . Since main is a
function like any other, it may return a value to its caller, which is in effect the environment in
which the program was executed. Typically, a return value of zero implies normal termination;
non-zero values signal unusual or erroneous termination conditions. In the interests of
simplicity, we have omitted return statements from our main functions up to this point, but
we will include them hereafter, as a reminder that programs should return status to their
environment.</p>

<p>The declaration</p>

<code>int power(int base, int n);</code>

<p>just before main says that power is a function that expects two int arguments and returns an
int . This declaration, which is called a function prototype, has to agree with the definition and
uses of power . It is an error if the definition of a function or any uses of it do not agree with its
prototype.</p>

<p>parameter names need not agree. Indeed, parameter names are optional in a function
prototype, so for the prototype we could have written</p>

<code>int power(int, int);</code>

<p>Well-chosen names are good documentation however, so we will often use them.</p>

<p>A note of history: the biggest change between ANSI C and earlier versions is how functions
are declared and defined. In the original definition of C, the power function would have been
written like this:</p>

<pre> <code>
    /* power: raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */
    /*(old-style version) */
    power(base, n)
    int base, n;
    {
        int i, p;
        p = 1;

        for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
            p = p * base;

        return p;
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>The parameters are named between the parentheses, and their types are declared before
opening the left brace; undeclared parameters are taken as int . (The body of the function is
the same as before.)</p>


<p>The declaration of power at the beginning of the program would have looked like this:</p>

<code>int power();</code>

<p>No parameter list was permitted, so the compiler could not readily check that power was being
called correctly. Indeed, since by default power would have been assumed to return an int , the
entire declaration might well have been omitted.</p>

<p>The new syntax of function prototypes makes it much easier for a compiler to detect errors in
the number of arguments or their types. The old style of declaration and definition still works
in ANSI C, at least for a transition period, but we strongly recommend that you use the new
form when you have a compiler that supports it.</p>

                <header class="section-header">
                    Arguments - Call by Value
                </header>

                <p>One aspect of C functions may be unfamiliar to programmers who are used to some other
languages, particulary Fortran. In C, all function arguments are passed ``by value.'' This means
that the called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables rather than
the originals. This leads to some different properties than are seen with ``call by reference''
languages like Fortran or with var parameters in Pascal, in which the called routine has access
to the original argument, not a local copy.</p>

<p>Call by value is an asset, however, not a liability. It usually leads to more compact programs
with fewer extraneous variables, because parameters can be treated as conveniently initialized
local variables in the called routine. For example, here is a version of power that makes use of
this property.</p>

<pre> <code>
    /* power: raise base to n-th power; n >= 0; version 2 */
    int power(int base, int n)
    {
        int p;

        for (p = 1; n > 0; --n)
            p = p * base;

        return p;
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>The parameter n is used as a temporary variable, and is counted down (a for loop that runs
backwards) until it becomes zero; there is no longer a need for the variable i . Whatever is
done to n inside power has no effect on the argument that power was originally called with.</p>

<p>When necessary, it is possible to arrange for a function to modify a variable in a calling routine.
The caller must provide the address of the variable to be set (technically a pointer to the29
variable), and the called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer and access the
variable indirectly through it. We will cover pointers in Chapter 5.</p>

<p>The story is different for arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value
passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array - there is no
copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any
argument of the array. This is the topic of the next section.</p>


            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Character_Arrays">
                <header class="section-header">
                    Character Arrays
                </header>
<p>The most common type of array in C is the array of characters. To illustrate the use of
character arrays and functions to manipulate them, let's write a program that reads a set of text
lines and prints the longest. The outline is simple enough:</p>

<pre> <code>
    while (there's another line)
        if (it's longer than the previous longest)
            (save it)
            (save its length)
    print longest line
</code> </pre>

<p>This outline makes it clear that the program divides naturally into pieces. One piece gets a new
line, another saves it, and the rest controls the process.</p>

<p>Since things divide so nicely, it would be well to write them that way too. Accordingly, let us
first write a separate function getline to fetch the next line of input. We will try to make the
function useful in other contexts. At the minimum, getline has to return a signal about
possible end of file; a more useful design would be to return the length of the line, or zero if
end of file is encountered. Zero is an acceptable end-of-file return because it is never a valid
line length. Every text line has at least one character; even a line containing only a newline has
length 1.</p>

<p>When we find a line that is longer than the previous longest line, it must be saved somewhere.
This suggests a second function, copy , to copy the new line to a safe place.</p>

<p>Finally, we need a main program to control getline and copy . Here is the result.</p>

<pre> <code>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #define MAXLINE 1000            /* maximum input line length */

    int getline(char line[], int maxline);
    void copy(char to[], char from[]);

    /* print the longest input line */

    main()
    {
        int len;                    /*current line length */
        int max;                    /*maximum length seen so far */
        char line[MAXLINE];         /* current input line */
        char longest[MAXLINE];      /* longest line saved here */

        max = 0;

        while ((len = getline(line, MAXLINE)) > 0)
            if (len > max) {
                max = len;
                copy(longest, line);
            }

        if (max > 0) /* there was a line */
            printf("%s", longest);

        return 0;
    }

    /* getline: read a line into s, return length */

    int getline(char s[],int lim)
    {
        int c, i;

        for (i=0; i < lim-1 && (c=getchar())!=EOF && c!='\n'; ++i)
            s[i] = c;

        if (c == '\n') {
            s[i] = c;
            ++i;
        }

        s[i] = '\0';
        return i;
    }

    /* copy: copy 'from' into 'to'; assume to is big enough */
    void copy(char to[], char from[])
    {
        int i;
        i = 0;

        while ((to[i] = from[i]) != '\0')
            ++i;
    }

</code> </pre>

<p>The functions getline and copy are declared at the beginning of the program, which we
assume is contained in one file.</p>

<p>main and getline communicate through a pair of arguments and a returned value. In
getline , the arguments are declared by the line</p>

<code>int getline(char s[], int lim);</code>

<p>which specifies that the first argument, s , is an array, and the second, lim , is an integer. The
purpose of supplying the size of an array in a declaration is to set aside storage. The length of
an array s is not necessary in getline since its size is set in main . getline uses return to
send a value back to the caller, just as the function power did. This line also declares that
getline returns an int ; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted.</p>

<p>Some functions return a useful value; others, like copy , are used only for their effect and return
no value. The return type of copy is void , which states explicitly that no value is returned.
getline puts the character '\0' (the null character, whose value is zero) at the end of the
array it is creating, to mark the end of the string of characters. This conversion is also used by
the C language: when a string constant like</p>

<code>"hello\n"</code>

<p>appears in a C program, it is stored as an array of characters containing the characters in the
string and terminated with a '\0' to mark the end.</p>

<p>The %s format specification in printf expects the corresponding argument to be a string
represented in this form. copy also relies on the fact that its input argument is terminated with
a '\0' , and copies this character into the output.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning in passing that even a program as small as this one presents some sticky
design problems. For example, what should main do if it encounters a line which is bigger than
its limit? getline works safely, in that it stops collecting when the array is full, even if no
newline has been seen. By testing the length and the last character returned, main can
determine whether the line was too long, and then cope as it wishes. In the interests of brevity,
we have ignored this issue.</p>

<p>There is no way for a user of getline to know in advance how long an input line might be, so
getline checks for overflow. On the other hand, the user of copy already knows (or can find
out) how big the strings are, so we have chosen not to add error checking to it.</p>

            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="External_Variables_and_Scope">
                <header class="section-header">
                    External Variables and Scope
                </header>

<p>The variables in main , such as line , longest , etc., are private or local to main . Because they
are declared within main , no other function can have direct access to them. The same is true of
the variables in other functions; for example, the variable i in getline is unrelated to the i in
copy. Each local variable in a function comes into existence only when the function is called,
and disappears when the function is exited. This is why such variables are usually known as
automatic variables, following terminology in other languages. We will use the term automatic
henceforth to refer to these local variables. (Chapter 4 discusses the static storage class, in
which local variables do retain their values between calls.)</p>

<p>Because automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not retain their
values from one call to the next, and must be explicitly set upon each entry. If they are not set,
they will contain garbage.</p>

<p>As an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are external to all
functions, that is, variables that can be accessed by name by any function. (This mechanism is
rather like Fortran COMMON or Pascal variables declared in the outermost block.) Because
external variables are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to
communicate data between functions. Furthermore, because external variables remain in
existence permanently, rather than appearing and disappearing as functions are called and
exited, they retain their values even after the functions that set them have returned.</p>

<p>An external variable must be defined, exactly once, outside of any function; this sets aside
storage for it. The variable must also be declared in each function that wants to access it; this
states the type of the variable. The declaration may be an explicit extern statement or may be
implicit from context. To make the discussion concrete, let us rewrite the longest-line program
with line , longest , and max as external variables. This requires changing the calls,
declarations, and bodies of all three functions.</p>

<pre> <code>
    #include "stdio.h"

    #define MAXLINE 1000     /* maximum input line size */

    int max;                /* maximum length seen so far */
    char line[MAXLINE];     /* current input line */
    char longest[MAXLINE];  /* longest line saved here */

    int getline(void);
    void copy(void);

    /* print longest input line; specialized version */

    main()
    {
        int len;
        extern int max;

        max = 0;
        while ((len = getline()) > 0)
            if (len > max) {
                max = len;
                copy();
            }

        if (max > 0)     /* there was a line */

    int getline(void)

        int c, i;
        extern char line[];

        for (i = 0; i < MAXLINE - 1 && (c=getchar)) != EOF && c != '\n'; ++i)
            line[i] = c;

            if (c == '\n') {
                line[i] = c;

        extern char line[], longest[];

        i = 0;

            ++i;
    }
</code> </pre>

<p>The external variables in main , getline and copy are defined by the first lines of the example
above, which state their type and cause storage to be allocated for them. Syntactically, external
definitions are just like definitions of local variables, but since they occur outside of functions,
the variables are external. Before a function can use an external variable, the name of the
variable must be made known to the function; the declaration is the same as before except for
the added keyword extern .</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, the extern declaration can be omitted. If the definition of the
external variable occurs in the source file before its use in a particular function, then there is no
need for an extern declaration in the function. The extern declarations in main , getline and
copy are thus redundant. In fact, common practice is to place definitions of all external
variables at the beginning of the source file, and then omit all extern declarations.</p>

<p>If the program is in several source files, and a variable is defined in file1 and used in file2 and
file3, then extern declarations are needed in file2 and file3 to connect the occurrences of the
variable. The usual practice is to collect extern declarations of variables and functions in a
separate file, historically called a header, that is included by #include at the front of each
source file. The suffix .h is conventional for header names. The functions of the standard
library, for example, are declared in headers like <stdio.h> . This topic is discussed at length
in Chapter 4, and the library itself in Chapter 7 and Appendix B.</p>

<p>Since the specialized versions of getline and copy have no arguments, logic would suggest
that their prototypes at the beginning of the file should be getline() and copy() . But for
compatibility with older C programs the standard takes an empty list as an old-style
declaration, and turns off all argument list checking; the word void must be used for an
explicitly empty list. We will discuss this further in Chapter 4.</p>

<p>You should note that we are using the words definition and declaration carefully when we
refer to external variables in this section.``Definition'' refers to the place where the variable is
created or assigned storage; ``declaration'' refers to places where the nature of the variable is
stated but no storage is allocated.</p>

<p>By the way, there is a tendency to make everything in sight an extern variable because it
appears to simplify communications - argument lists are short and variables are always there
when you want them. But external variables are always there even when you don't want them.
Relying too heavily on external variables is fraught with peril since it leads to programs whose
data connections are not all obvious - variables can be changed in unexpected and even
inadvertent ways, and the program is hard to modify. The second version of the longest-line
program is inferior to the first, partly for these reasons, and partly because it destroys the
generality of two useful functions by writing into them the names of the variables they
manipulate.</p>

<p>At this point we have covered what might be called the conventional core of C. With this
handful of building blocks, it's possible to write useful programs of considerable size, and it
would probably be a good idea if you paused long enough to do so. These exercises suggest
programs of somewhat greater complexity than the ones earlier in this chapter.</p>
